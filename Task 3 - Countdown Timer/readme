# Countdown Timer Application
A dynamic and interactive countdown timer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project allows users to set a countdown to a specific date and time, start, pause, reset, and visually track the remaining time with smooth animations.
It features an intuitive interface and real-time updates.

# Features
-> User-Friendly Interface: A simple and clean design to easily input a countdown time and control the timer.
-> Time Selection: Users can select a specific future date and time to countdown to, with validation to prevent selecting past times.
-> Start, Pause, Reset Functionality: Users can start, pause, and reset the countdown with intuitive buttons.
-> Real-Time Display: The remaining time is updated instantly, showing days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
-> Animations: When the countdown is close to finishing, the display triggers a visual animation.
-> Alert on Completion: A notification is displayed when the countdown reaches zero, along with an automatic reset.
-> Error Handling: Alerts notify users if invalid or past dates are selected, automatically adjusting to a valid future time.

# Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the countdown timer.
CSS: Handles styling and animations.
JavaScript: Manages countdown functionality, event handling, and real-time updates.

# Functionalities
Set Countdown: Users can select a future date and time to start a countdown.
Start Countdown: Begins the countdown, calculating and displaying the time remaining.
Pause Countdown: Users can pause the countdown at any time and resume it later.
Reset Countdown: Reset the timer, clearing the countdown and allowing the user to set a new one.
Validation: Automatically checks that a valid future date and time is selected.
Animations: When the timer is close to completion, an animation is triggered to draw attention to the countdown.
Alert on Finish: A notification alerts users when the countdown is complete, and the timer resets.

# How It Works
Event Listeners: JavaScript event listeners (e.g., "click") handle user interactions, such as starting, pausing, and resetting the countdown.
Date and Time Validation: The selected countdown time is validated to ensure it is a future time. If an invalid time is selected, it prompts the user with an alert and adjusts the time accordingly.
Real-Time Updates: The remaining time is calculated and displayed dynamically, with precision down to seconds.
Animations: When the countdown reaches the last 10 seconds, an animation effect is applied to the time display to create a sense of urgency.
Task Persistence: The countdown state is managed in JavaScript and cleared upon completion or reset.
